What is Software Development Life Cycle ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> The SDLC refers to a methodology
-> SDLC clearly defines the process of creating high-quality software project
-> SDLC methodology focuses on below phases of software development


1) Requirements Analysis(requirements given by client)
2) Planning
3) Software Design or Architectural Design
4) Development(coding)
5) Testing
6) Deployment
7) Deliver
8) Support(If any issue occurred in project then company will give u free support for three months) or maintenance

-> We have several methodologies in SDLC
1) Waterfall Model
2) V-Model
3) Spiral Model
4) Agile Model

+++++++++++++
Waterfall Model
++++++++++++++
-> Waterfall Model introduced in 1970
-> The waterfall Model was the first model that introduced as Process Model.
-> It is a linear or sequential approach to develop software projects
-> It is also called as step By step approach to develop the projects
-> In this model we will comple one phase then we will move on to next phase

++++++++++++++++++
When to use Waterfall
++++++++++++++++++
-> When requirements are fixed
-> When Project is small
-> When budget if fixed

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Dis-Advantages of Waterfall
+++++++++++++++++++++++
-> Risk is high
-> Requirements can't be changed in middle
-> We can't go to previous phase
-> Testing will happen at the end
-> Client involvement is very very less

#################
Agile Methodology
################
-> Agile is one of the SDLC methodology
-> It is a way to manage the project by breaking into several phases
-> Agile is also called as an iterative approach to develop and deliver the project
-> We can achieve continuous development and continuous delivery using Agile Model
-> It involves constant colloboration with stake holders (clients)
-> Continuous improvement at every stage
-> Client Feedback is most critical part in Agile
-> In Agile, Planning, Implementing, Testing and Delivering is a cyclic process

++++++++++++++
Sprint
++++++++++++++++
->sprint is nothing but one release.
->Sprint is nothing but  set of goals.
->In this first sprint i want to deliver 30 requirements to the client.
In agile methodology,the requirements are called as stories.Story nothing but a task
->So 30 stories we are going to deliver in 1st sprint.
35 stories we are going to deliver in second sprint so we are going to design planning,designing,developing,testing,deploy,review,launch.It is continuous process

++++++++++++++++
Agile Terminology
++++++++++++++++
Backlog Grooming  : Team meeting to identify pending works
Stories  : Tasks (work)
Story Points : Duration to complte the story (3 points - 1 day, 5 points - 2 days, 8 Points - 3 days)
Sprint Planning : Team meeting to identify priority stories to work
Sprint  : Set of stories to complete (Sprint Goal) & Sprint Duration - 2 weeks (10 working days)
Scrum or stand up call: It is a process   (Daily team meeting to discuss work status - 15 - 20 minutes) 
Retrospective : Review meeting after sprint(s) completed 
				(What went well, What went wrong, achievements, improvements, lessons learnt, new ideas)


###########
Agile Roles
###########
Product Owner : Responsible for Deliveriables
Scrum Master  : Who will manage Agile teams
Tech Lead  : Seniour Team Members (Who will help team members technically)
Team Members : Developers & Testers

*************  Agile Team Size : 7 - 10 members (Industry Standards)  ***************


#########
JIRA Tool
#########
-> JIRA is an atlasian company product          Note;github is also atlassian company product
-> JIRA is a paid software
Note: We can use trail version of JIRA for practise purpose
-> In companies we will use Paid version of JIRA
-> JIRA is used to manage project work
-> We can use JIRA as a bug reporting tool also
-> We will create Stories(tasks), Sprints in JIRA Sofware
-> For Team members, work will be assigned in JIRA software only


##############
JIRA Lab Work
##############
1) Create Trail Account in JIRA
2) Create Project in JIRA
3) Create Stories in Backlog
4) Assign Story Points for each story.
5) Add stories to Sprint and Start the Sprint
6) Assign the story to yourself and change story status

		Todo->they are in pending state
		In-Progress
		Done


Backlog nothing but pending work

Sprint planning means prioritizing the stories.or the process of prioritizing the backlog stories is called as sprint planning.
===========================================================================================================================================
JIRA is project management & bug reporting tool

story creation
story points
sprint creation
story assignments
story status change

=>If we are unable to complete story within a given time then we should justify the reason

why we are not able to complete
what is challenging thing
do we need any help?

=>In sprint we will create some placeholder stories,placeholder nothing but unexpected events/adhoc stories/buffer stories we are going to keep.

Any issues come all of sudden any unexpected work which we get in the sprint to complete that work we are going to use place holder
============================================================================================
Epic means grouping.set of stories we can group

goruping of stories is called as epic
================================================================================
->who will create user stories in your project   Ans:All the team members can create stories in the backlog

->who will assign stories to team members      Ans:In some projects scrum master will assign/in some projects tech lead will assign/in some project self assignments

I will Assign the story to myself

->once sprint started can we change story points of a story    Ans:No we should not

->If you are not able to complete story within a given time then what will u do    Ans:We need to inform to our scrum master why it is taking more time

->If you are not able to join  scrum call then how u will provide your work status to scrum master   Ans:We will send an email.we need to sent our work status to scrum master in email if u are not able to join a scrum call

===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
+++++++++++++++
sprint goal
++++++++++++++++

No of team members===>10
Daily Each Team Member===>3 points
10 Working days===>10*3==>30 points for a day
10days*30points===>300points


Note:In sprint planning meeting we should inform our  leave plans based  on that  sprint will be planned.
