Tell me About Yourself
======================
=>Thank you for the opportunity. 
I have around 5.10 years of experience as a Java backend developer, with a strong background in developing scalable, secure, and high-performing web applications using Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture.

=>I started my career working on monolithic Java applications and gradually transitioned into microservices-based development. 
Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Spring Boot, REST APIs, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate. 
I regularly use tools like Maven for build management and have worked with relational databases such as MySQL ,including writing and optimizing complex SQL queries.

=>For API development and testing, I use Postman for functional validation and Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API documentation.

=>For code quality, I follow best practices using SonarQube to track code coverage and maintainability metrics. 
I also write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability and reduce bugs in production.

=>On the cloud side, I’ve worked with various AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS,VPC  and ALB for deploying and maintaining applications. 
I’m also familiar with containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. 
While I closely collaborate with DevOps teams for CI/CD processes, I understand how CI/CD pipelines are structured using tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

=>One of the key projects I’ve worked on is the MSIL Claim Bonus Automation System for Maruti Suzuki, which automates the end-to-end claim bonus process for dealers. 
The system is developed using Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and AWS.
 My primary responsibilities included designing and developing backend services, integrating with third-party APIs, and coordinating with the SmartBot team for automated document processing. 
I was also involved in managing claim status updates through workflow-based logic

=>We follow the Agile methodology in our development process, which includes daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure continuous delivery and timely feedback.

=>In addition to development, I regularly participate in code reviews, help resolve production issues, and contribute to system performance optimization. 
I also enjoy mentoring junior team members and collaborating with cross-functional teams including QA, UI, and DevOps.

=>Beyond technical expertise, I believe in strong communication, teamwork, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. 
I’m currently looking for a role where I can leverage my backend and cloud experience, contribute to impactful projects, and grow into a solution architect role in the near future.

=>I recently worked at Nividous Software Solutions, where I served for 2 years and 10 months, contributing to the MSIL project. 
Prior to that, I worked at Softwin Technologies Pvt. Ltd. for approximately 3 years, where I gained solid hands-on experience with Java and enterprise applications
