AR requirement
=============

create project with 5 dependencies spring data jpa,lombok,devtools,actuator,spring web

Application Registration (AR) module contains Citizen Onboarding functionality & it will verify citenship of the citizen. 
If citizen belongs to NJ state then application should be created & it should return application id as response .
If citizen  not belongs to nj state then we should return "invalid ssn" as response

ssa-web-endpoint url: "https://ssa-web-api.herokuapp.com/ssn/{ssn}"
ip:ssn as a path parameter
op:state name

to make a call using web client ..use dependency spring-boot-starter-webflux

 * WebClient webClient=WebClient.create();
		 * 
		 * String stateName=webClient.get()//it represents get request
		 * .uri(endPointUrl,app.getSsn())//it represents url to send request .retrieve()//to retrieve
		 * response .bodyToMono(String.class)//to specify response type .block();//to
		 * make synchronous call means ater mnaking a request i need to wait for a
		 * response
		 */

Diff between rest template & web client
rest Templte is used to make synchronus call while web client is used to make synch & asynch calls


why we use syn calls in this because after coming my response..my next logic is depend on that response

if we want to execute our program continuous then we can go for aync calls


frontend data mapping should be done with binding classes
database data mapping should be done with the entity classes
