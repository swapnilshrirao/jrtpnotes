how to tell 2 years gap
========================
I took two years off from work due to personal reasons related to my marriage and divorce.
 During this period, I made it a priority to stay updated on technology and worked on refining my skills in Java development and AWS infrastructure.
 Now, I’m eager to bring my 7 years of experience back into a full-time role. I’ve remained committed to my professional growth, and I’m confident that I can quickly adapt to new challenges and contribute effectively to your team




============CARRER GAP=====================

After my role at Infovision, I took a career break for personal reasons, which I initially anticipated to be short-term but extended to around 2.5 years. 

However, I made it a priority to stay connected to my field during this time. 

I dedicated myself to continuous learning, completing advanced certifications in Java and AWS, and I built several personal projects to keep my skills sharp.

 I also took on freelance work, including backend consulting for a small business, which helped me stay current with industry standards.

Additionally, this period gave me valuable time for reflection and focus, allowing me to better understand the areas of software development that drive me, like backend optimization and cloud solutions. 

Now, I’m excited to return to a full-time role with renewed energy and a strong commitment to contributing to meaningful projects. 

I’m confident that my experience and readiness will allow me to quickly integrate with the team and add value.
