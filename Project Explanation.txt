Direct Wines
+========================

In the United States, wine label registration refers to the process of submitting and obtaining approval for wine labels from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB),
 which is a part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
 The TTB regulates and enforces federal laws and regulations related to the production, distribution, and labeling of alcoholic beverages, including wine.

Wine label registration is a crucial step for wineries and wine producers to ensure compliance with labeling requirements and to legally sell their products in the United States. 
Here are some key aspects of wine label registration in the USA:

1. Certificate of Label Approval (COLA): The TTB requires wineries to obtain a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) for their wine labels. 
The COLA serves as official permission to use the specific label design and content for a particular wine product. 
The label design must comply with various regulations, including font size, mandatory information placement, health warnings, and specific statements or claims.

2. Label Submission Process: To register a wine label, wineries must submit the label design and relevant information to the TTB through the COLAs Online system. 
The submission includes details such as the brand name, class and type of wine, alcohol content, sulfite declaration, net contents, and other required statements.
 The TTB reviews the label submission for compliance with regulations before issuing the COLA.

3. Label Changes and Amendments: Any modifications or changes to an approved wine label, such as altering the design, adding or removing statements, or changing the brand name, require a new COLA. 
Wineries must submit the revised label for review and approval before using it on their products.

4. Appellation of Origin: For wines labeled with an appellation of origin, such as American Viticultural Area (AVA) or state-specific designations, wineries must comply with additional regulations to ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the geographical indication on the label.

It's important for wineries to familiarize themselves with the specific requirements outlined by the TTB and follow them to avoid violations or potential penalties. 
By obtaining proper wine label registration and COLAs, wineries can ensure that their labels meet regulatory standards, accurately represent their products, and maintain compliance with U.S. laws regarding wine labeling.

The primary technologies involved in this project are Business Process Management (BPM), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and Smart Bots.

-> BPM plays a crucial role in orchestrating and managing the end-to-end claims processing lifecycle. 
We have implemented a BPM system to define, model, execute, and monitor the various steps involved in processing an dealer claim.
 This includes capturing initial information like document required to process a claim also validate claim.

->RPA is leveraged to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks in the claims processing workflow. 
We have identified routine tasks such as data entry, document verification, and information extraction, and deployed RPA bots to handle these tasks efficiently. 
This not only accelerates the claims processing time but also reduces the chances of human errors.


->Certainly. RPA bots are employed to automatically extract relevant information from documents, validate policy details, and update the claims database. 
For instance, when a claim is submitted, the RPA bot extracts data from supporting documents like invoices or photos, validates it against predefined rules, and updates the system accordingly.

->Java is the backbone of this project, serving as the primary programming language for building and maintaining the various components. 
From developing custom modules in the BPM system to creating connectors for RPA bots and implementing APIs for seamless integration, Java plays a pivotal role in ensuring the cohesiveness and efficiency of the entire automation ecosystem.

->The process involves granting bonus for institutional sales/RSL/Commercial Aquisition claims/Bulk Acuisation claims & Exchange claim &  discrepency claims.

->The process starts when the punches dealer the claim into DMS system and uploads the relevant documents into the workflow system.
->Auditor manually validates the documents to take appropriate action - accept, reject, request clarification. 
->Auditor can also submit the request to Department head in case of forged claims.

*******Main goal of projects*******

->The primary goal appears to be streamlining and automating the bonus granting all process, ensuring the validity of claims and minimizing the risk of fraudulent activities. 
->This process aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and accountability in managing sales-related bonuses within the institution.

5. The dealer must upload all the mandatory documents and accept the undertaking to submit the claim. Once documents submitted/re-submitted against the claim raised then claim will move to the queue of MSIL Auditor to review.

2MSIL Auditor role:
 
MSIL Auditor verifies the claim details under the MSIL Auditor’s queue for manual verification and take appropriate actions. 
Accept: The claims will be completed in workflow system and cannot be re-opened in workflow
Reject: Based on the rejection reason selected by the L1 Approver / Auditor following scenarios are possible:
a.Claims will go the department head (L2 Approver) for approval 
b.Claims will be rejected by L1 approver. Rejected Claims will be active in workflow in a wait state for a configurable time and can be reopened in DMS before wait period is over.

Clarification Required: The claim will move to the Dealer’s queue (Upload Documents). This can be sent at most two times for clarification, the third time the Claim must be Approved or Rejected.

3 Department Head role:

Claim will move to Department head queue only if the claim has already been sent for clarification to the dealer at least once and basis the relevant rejection reason selected by the auditor,
Department head working on the “Rejection Pending Approval” claim can perform either of the two actions mentioned below:
Send Back to Auditor: Claim will be moved back to the Auditor’s Queue (Auditor Review)
Reject: Claim will be moved to the Wait state.

=========================================

1.Start step (Auto) :
